Chartbox 
===============================================================

Chartbox implements .... a whole bunch of random stuff... for autonomous navigation.

More precisely, it implements a probabalistic occupancy grid, split into tiles for performant lookup.  Each tile is the leaf node of a quadtree.  Thus the library provides a quadtree spanning the robot's entire world: that is, a world-tree.

The library also intends to provide an interface for pathfinding algorithms, like A*. 

Purpose
-------

While quadtrees have a wide variety of uses, this implementation is designed to partition space into allowable area, and blocked area.  (Both may be convex, concave, or disjoint.)  The allowable nature of the space is tracked on a square-area basis (in fact, the include reference implementation is a grid.)

For instance, imagine a robot in a room; in order to locate the robot in the room, and the boundaries of the room.

Build
-----
This project uses CMake as its primary build system. `make debug` in the base directory should automatically build all executables.
