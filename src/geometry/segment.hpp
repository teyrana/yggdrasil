    // Abstract
    // An algorithm is presented for converting a boundary representation for an
    // image to its region quadtree representation. Our algorithm is designed
    // for operation on the linear quadtree representation, although it can
    // easily be modified for the traditional pointer-based quadtree
    // representation. The algorithm is a two phase process that first creates
    // linear quadtree node records for each of the border pixels. This list of
    // pixels is then sorted by locational code. The second processing phase
    // fills in the nodes interior to the polygons by simulating a traversal of
    // the corresponding pointer-based quadtree. Three previous algorithms have
    // described similar conversion routines requiring time complexity of O(n ·
    // B) for at least one of the two phases, where B is the number of boundary
    // pixels and n is the depth of the final tree for a 2n×2n image. A fourth
    // algorithm, developed by Webber, can perform the border construction of
    // this conversion in time O(n
    // + B) with the restriction that the polygon must be positioned at
    // constrained locations in the image space. Our algorithm requires time O(n
    // + B) for the second phase, which is optimal. The first phase can be
    // performed using the algorithm of Webber for total conversion time of O(n
    // + B) with constrained location, in time O(B log B) using a simple sort to
    // order the border pixels with no restriction in polygon location, or by a
    // Jordan sequence sorting algorithm in time O(B) also with no restriction
    // in polygon location.
